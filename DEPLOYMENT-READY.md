- [x] GitHub secrets setup helper: `scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh`
- [x] Deployment helper scripts in `package.json`
- [x] Rollback procedures documented

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Action Required)

To complete the deployment, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets (5 minutes)

Run the setup helper:

```bash
npm run deploy:setup
```

Then add these secrets to GitHub (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions):

| Secret Name           | Where to Get It                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`        | Your Supabase/PostgreSQL connection string  |
| `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` | Same as DATABASE_URL (or direct pooler URL) |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN`        | https://vercel.com/account/tokens           |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID`       | Vercel Project Settings â†’ General           |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`   | Vercel Project Settings â†’ General           |

### 2. Verify Vercel Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel (Settings â†’ Environment Variables):

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- `GITHUB_ID`
- `GITHUB_SECRET`

### 3. Deploy

The deployment will happen automatically when you push to `main`:

```bash
# Already done! The latest push will trigger deployment
# Monitor at: https://github.com/javieralaves/disco-agent/actions
```

Or manually trigger:

```bash
# From GitHub
# Go to: Actions â†’ Deploy to Production â†’ Run workflow

# Or locally with Vercel CLI
vercel --prod
```

### 4. Verify Deployment (After Deploy)

**Check Database:**

```sql
-- Verify new columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'series' AND column_name = 'preInterviewQuestions';

SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'sessions' AND column_name = 'participantContext';
```

**Test the Feature:**

1. Create a new research series
2. Verify Step 4 appears: "Pre-Interview Questions"
3. Test AI question generation
4. Use invite link as participant
5. Answer pre-interview questions
6. Start interview and verify AI uses context

**Monitor Logs:**

```bash
# View deployment logs
vercel logs --prod

# Or in GitHub Actions
# https://github.com/javieralaves/disco-agent/actions
```

## ðŸ“Š What the Workflow Does

When you push to `main`, GitHub Actions automatically:

1. âœ… **Installs dependencies** â†’ `npm ci`
2. âœ… **Generates Prisma Client** â†’ `npx prisma generate`
3. âœ… **Runs database migrations** â†’ `npx prisma migrate deploy`
4. âœ… **Deploys to Vercel** â†’ Production deployment

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### Quick Vercel Rollback:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Find previous deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"

### Database Rollback:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "series" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "preInterviewQuestions";
ALTER TABLE "sessions" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "participantContext";
```

### Code Rollback:

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```
