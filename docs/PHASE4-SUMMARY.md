## üìä Database Updates

**Session Model Fields Used:**

- `summary` (Json) - Complete structured summary
- `sentiment` (String) - Overall sentiment (POSITIVE/NEUTRAL/NEGATIVE)
- `suggestedActions` (Json) - Array of action items with rationale
- `summarized` (Boolean) - Processing status flag

No schema changes required - these fields were already in the database schema!

## üß™ Testing the Flow

### 1. View Sessions List

```bash
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/sessions
```

- Should see all completed interview sessions
- Sessions should show "Pending Analysis" or "Summarized" badge

### 2. View Session Details

- Click on any session
- Should see full transcript with speaker identification
- If not summarized, see "Generate Summary" button

### 3. Generate Summary

- Click "Generate Summary" button
- Wait for AI processing (10-30 seconds depending on conversation length)
- Page refreshes automatically
- Summary sections appear with color-coded insights

### 4. Review Summary

- Check sentiment badge
- Review key insights
- Explore problems, goals, friction, opportunities
- Read suggested actions with priorities

3. **Review insights category by category** - Each section provides different perspectives
4. **Use quotes for evidence** - All insights include supporting quotes
5. **Export or share** - You can copy insights for reports or presentations

### Best Practices:

- Generate summaries soon after interviews while context is fresh
- Review suggested actions and prioritize based on your roadmap
- Use sentiment to gauge overall participant satisfaction
- Compare insights across multiple sessions to find patterns
