## AI Integration

### OpenAI GPT-4o Usage

**Model**: `gpt-4o`

**Two AI Endpoints**:

1. **Generate Goals** (`/api/series/generate-goals`)

   - Temperature: 0.7
   - Max tokens: 1000
   - Returns: JSON array of 3-5 research goals
   - Prompt includes: research focus + optional context

2. **Generate Questions** (`/api/series/generate-questions`)
   - Temperature: 0.7
   - Max tokens: 2000
   - Returns: JSON array of question objects with goal references
   - Prompt includes: research focus, goals, and context

**Prompt Engineering**:

- System role: "UX research expert"
- JSON-only responses for easy parsing
- Specific instructions for quality:
  - Goals: Specific, measurable, actionable
  - Questions: Open-ended, storytelling-focused
  - No yes/no questions

---

## User Experience Flow

1. **User clicks "New Series"** on dashboard
2. **Step 1**: Enters research focus and optional context
3. **Step 2**: AI generates goals → User reviews/edits
4. **Step 3**: AI generates questions → User reviews/edits
5. **Completion**: Series saved to database
6. **Redirect**: Taken to series detail page
7. **Share**: Copy invite link to share with participants

## Testing the Series Wizard

### Prerequisites

1. OpenAI API key configured in `.env.local`:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

2. Servers running:
   ```bash
   npm run dev          # Next.js on :3000
   npm run db:studio    # Prisma Studio on :5555
   ```

### Test Flow

1. **Sign in** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Click "New Series"** on dashboard
3. **Step 1**: Fill in research focus
   - Title: "Q4 User Onboarding Research"
   - Research Focus: "Why do users abandon our onboarding flow?"
   - Optional context: Add company/product details
4. **Step 2**: Review AI-generated goals
   - Should see 3-5 specific research goals
   - Try editing/removing/adding goals
   - Click "Regenerate" to get new suggestions
5. **Step 3**: Review AI-generated questions
   - Should see 2-3 questions per goal
   - Questions should be open-ended
   - Try adding custom questions
6. **Complete**: Click "Create Series"
7. **Verify**: Should redirect to series detail page
   - See invite link
   - See all goals and questions
   - Check Prisma Studio for new Series record

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No drag-to-reorder** for questions (planned for Phase 3)
2. **Consent text** is hardcoded (will be customizable later)
3. **No series editing** after creation (planned for Phase 4)
4. **No invite page** yet (Phase 3)
5. **Status always "draft"** (activation in Phase 3)

---

## Next Steps: Phase 3

**Interview Capture**:

1. Participant landing page (`/invite/[code]`)
2. Consent form with version tracking
3. Microphone check component
4. OpenAI Realtime API integration
5. Live interview transcription
6. Session recording and storage

---

## Performance Notes

- **AI generation time**: ~2-5 seconds per request
- **Wizard navigation**: Instant (client-side state)
- **Form validation**: Real-time with Zod
- **Database writes**: < 100ms for series creation

---
