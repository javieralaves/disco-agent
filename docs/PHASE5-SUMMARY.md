---

## ✅ What Was Built

### **5.1: Theme Generation Endpoint** ✅

**Location:** `/api/series/generate-themes`

**Features:**

- GPT-4o powered analysis across multiple sessions
- Identifies recurring patterns and themes
- Calculates multi-factor confidence scores
- Creates Evidence records linking themes to specific turns
- Automatic theme and evidence database storage

**Confidence Score Components:**

```typescript
{
  volumeScore: 0-1,        // Amount of evidence (normalized to 10+ items)
  diversityScore: 0-1,     // Spread across sessions
  recencyScore: 0-1,       // Freshness (decay over 30 days)
  consistencyScore: 0-1,   // Consistency across sessions
  contradictionScore: 0-1, // Contradictory evidence penalty
}

overall = (volume × 0.25) + (diversity × 0.30) +
          (recency × 0.15) + (consistency × 0.30) -
          (contradiction × 0.10)
```

**AI Analysis Output:**

```typescript
{
  themes: Array<{
    title: string;
    rationale: string;
    evidence: Array<{
      sessionId: string;
      quote: string;

## 📊 Database Structure

**Theme Model:**

- `title` - Brief theme name
- `rationale` - Detailed pattern explanation
- `factors` - Contributing elements (JSON array)
- `confidence` - Overall score (0-1)
- `sessionCount` - Number of sessions involved
- `evidenceCount` - Number of evidence items
- `volumeScore`, `diversityScore`, `recencyScore`, `consistencyScore`, `contradictionScore` - Components

**Evidence Model:**

- `themeId` - Links to Theme
- `sessionId` - Source session
- `turnId` - Specific conversation turn (optional)

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Researchers:

1. **Complete at least 2-3 sessions first** - Themes require patterns across multiple interviews
2. **Summarize all sessions** - Theme generation only includes summarized sessions
3. **Regenerate themes regularly** - Run after adding new sessions to update patterns
4. **Review confidence scores** - Focus on high-confidence themes (75%+)
5. **Trace evidence** - Click through to verify quotes in context

### Best Practices:

- Wait until you have 3+ completed sessions for meaningful themes
- Review themes after each batch of 3-5 new sessions
- Use high-confidence themes for reporting and decision-making
- Low-confidence themes may indicate emerging patterns worth watching
- Click through evidence links to verify context
