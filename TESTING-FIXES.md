# Testing Fixes Summary

All issues from the testing report have been fixed! Here's what was addressed:

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. **Series List Page (404 â†’ Working)**

- **Issue**: Clicking "Series" in left navigation gave 404
- **Fix**: Created `/app/series/page.tsx` with a comprehensive series list view
- **File**: `src/app/series/page.tsx`

### 2. **Sessions Route Update**

- **Issue**: Sessions was at `/dashboard/sessions` instead of `/sessions`
- **Fix**:
  - Created new routes at `/app/sessions/page.tsx` and `/app/sessions/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Updated sidebar navigation to point to `/sessions`
  - Updated all links throughout the app to use `/sessions/[id]`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/sessions/page.tsx` (new)
  - `src/app/sessions/[id]/page.tsx` (copied from dashboard)
  - `src/components/layout/sidebar-nav.tsx`
  - `src/app/series/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/themes/[id]/page.tsx`

### 3. **Dashboard Layout for All Pages**

- **Issue**: Themes, Chat, Settings pages missing left navigation
- **Fix**: Added `layout.tsx` with `DashboardLayout` to all routes
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/app/themes/layout.tsx`
  - `src/app/chat/layout.tsx`
  - `src/app/settings/layout.tsx`
  - `src/app/series/layout.tsx`
  - `src/app/sessions/layout.tsx`

### 4. **Participant Name in Transcript**

- **Issue**: Session detail page showed "Participant" instead of actual name
- **Fix**: Updated transcript to display `participantName` when available
- **File**: `src/app/sessions/[id]/page.tsx` (line 391)

### 5. **Research Goals Flickering**

- **Issue**: Goals were generated multiple times causing flicker
- **Fix**: Added `hasGeneratedRef` to prevent duplicate API calls
- **File**: `src/app/series/new/steps/research-goals.tsx`
